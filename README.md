Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is available in the diabetes2.csv file. The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome (target variable, 1 indicates diabetes, 0 indicates no diabetes)
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd diabetes-prediction
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python diabetes_analysis.py
Analysis and Visualization
The script performs the following data analysis and visualization tasks:

Displays dataset information and summary statistics.
Checks for missing values.
Generates box plots for each feature grouped by the outcome.
Plots histograms for each feature grouped by the outcome.
Calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Example visualizations include:

Pairplots
Box plots for features such as Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age.
Histograms for features based on diabetes outcome.
Violin plots to visualize the distribution of features.
Model Training and Evaluation
The script trains a logistic regression model using the following steps:

Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Fits a logistic regression model to the training data.
Predicts outcomes on the test data.
Evaluates the model using confusion matrix and classification report.
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Mean Squared Error
